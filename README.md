# P-EZ-Mobile-App-in-kotlin
An original solution to the ID PASSWORD problem

"FISH DEV PRESENTS P-EZ: P-EZ is an original mobile application for managing connections, IDs, and passwords...

Introduction: Initially, this app was developed to learn and get familiar with mobile app development... Having no idea where to start, I decided to develop an application that addresses recurring issues with connections... Let's face it, who hasn't lost access to their account due to a forgotten password or ID? And I'm not alone, with the increasing use of the internet and multiple accounts, it's a problem for millions of people...

WAIT FOR IT... You might say, "Okay, Fish, but there are already apps that can manage that!" Okay, I respond, "And how do you access those apps?" With a password or a key... LOL And what if you lose it?! Back to the problem that led me to the real question: In terms of identification and authorization, are we still stuck with passwords in the age of AI?!

I started thinking about the concept of identification in humans... I wondered, what makes us unique and perfectly identifiable among our peers?! Sight, writing, hearing, because we recognize each other's voices, experiences, because only Moos and I know about that night (example, lol)...

So, to respond effectively and simply for the user, I developed (60% creation phase) P-EZ.

PRESENTATION: So, what does your thing do, Fish?! It's very simple; it's a mobile application (desktop version coming soon). You download the app from the official website or store (version 1.0 Android, other versions coming soon). You install it, and it's quick! Then comes a configuration phase where the app interacts with you... This phase is critical and requires the user to take their time, about 5-20 minutes.

The interaction is multiple; it can be questions, voice samples, photos or images... I don't want to detail this phase too much, but it's the heart of the application...

Once the app is configured, it will manage your connections, IDs, and passwords... When the app "needs it," it identifies the user without a key or password. In terms of security, the app is compiled, the data it manages is encrypted, and of course, it proposes the most secure password compatible with the site you're connecting to...

The app offers a higher security standard than most mobile apps in 2025. However, it's designed for everyday use, not for maximum security, but it still offers top-notch security! The app is discreet, ergonomic, and simple to use...

No more password misery, no more need to keep keys in a safe or remember anything! 

ON Dev,
STAY TUNED!!
